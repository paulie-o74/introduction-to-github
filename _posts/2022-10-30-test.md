Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba will miss France's World Cup defence in Qatar as he needs more time to recover from a knee operation.

Pogba, 29, has not played for the Serie A side this season since re-joining from Manchester United in the summer.

He suffered a knee injury in July and initially opted not to have surgery in a bid to be fit for the tournament.

France's first World Cup match is against Australia on 22 November.

In a statement on Monday, Pogba's agent Rafaela Pimenta said: "Following yesterday's and today's medical review in Torino and Pittsburgh, it is extremely painful to inform Paul Pogba will still need recovery time from his surgery.
